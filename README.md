# D3_interactiveLinePliot_4
The code will generate an interactive lineplot, based on timedata over a year. The lines can be clicked on for receiving statistical results. 
The points can be hovered over for receiving the exact value.

 To run the project please make sure to have all files in one folder and start a local server inside this folder, e.g. `python -m http.server 8080`
